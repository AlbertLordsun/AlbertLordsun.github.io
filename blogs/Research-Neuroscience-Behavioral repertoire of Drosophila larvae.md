title: Behavioral repertoire of Drosophila larvae
---

The genetic analysis of Drosophila behavior and of the brain structures controlling it was strongly in fluenced by two types of studies. 
The isolation of behavioral mutants by countercurrent distribution and of three clock mutants with different phenotypes 
that are all caused by mutations in the same gene, period, 
showed that isolation of genetic mutants affecting specific behaviors was possible. 
On the other hand, the isolation of structural brain mutants by Heisenberg and colleagues has given insight into e.g. 
the role of the mushroom bodies in learning, the role of the central complex in walking behavior, 
and the role of the optic lobes in vision, thereby linking specific parts of the brain to specific behaviors. 
Since these studies, the behavioral repertoire of Drosophila has proven to be amazingly complex. 
This is reflected in the range of techniques described below [1].
