title: Behavioral repertoire of Drosophila larvae
---

Functional and anatomical dissection of neural circuits is often hindered by the complexity of such systems. With only 10,000 neurons, the central nervous system of the Drosophila larva is at least one order of magnitude simpler than its adult counterpart. Despite this numerical simplicity, the behavioral repertoire of the larva contains a surprisingly diverse array of sophisticated behaviors. Larvae demonstrate *robust orientation behavior* toward light and odors (phototaxis and chemotaxis). The sensory organs and circuits underlying these behaviors are greatly reduced in comparison with the adult: the larval eye is composed of just 12 photoreceptor neurons, the nose of just 21 olfactory sensory neurons. While the larval olfactory pathway displays remarkable structural similarities with the adult system its numerical simplicity facilitates the analysis of individual, genetically identifiable neurons at anatomical and functional levels.

The genetic analysis of Drosophila behavior and of the brain structures controlling it was strongly influenced by two types of studies. 1) The isolation of behavioral mutants by countercurrent distribution and of three clock mutants with different phenotypes that are all caused by mutations in the same gene, period, showed that isolation of genetic mutants affecting specific behaviors was possible. 2) the isolation of structural brain mutants by Heisenberg and colleagues has given insight into e.g. the role of the mushroom bodies in learning, the role of the central complex in walking behavior, and the role of the optic lobes in vision, thereby linking specific parts of the brain to specific behaviors. Since these studies, the behavioral repertoire of Drosophila has proven to be amazingly complex. This is reflected in the range of techniques described below [1].

The simplicity of the larval sensory systems allows us to aim for a comprehensive and systems-level understanding of the relationships between circuit anatomy and function, from *afferent sensory neurons* through to *higher brain centers where orientation decisions are made* and communicated to *efferent motor neurons*.

## Behaviors of Drosophila larvae
* Aggressive
 
 Aggression is a well-known trait throughout the animal kingdom. It is essential for a variety of elementary functions like acquisition of food or mates and defense against predators. By contrast, excessive aggression requires high-energy depending acts that are evolutionary unfavorable.
* Circadian behavior and sleep
* Arousal
* Courtship
* Feeding/Gustatory behavior

 Feeding is a vital behavior for all organisms. It is necessary to facilitate growth, to insure survival and to meet reproductive requirements. Feeding can be regulated by multiple factors such as metabolic requirements, feeding status and different sensory inputs, including olfactory and gustatory signals. Furthermore, this behavior includes multiple decision-making processes, some obvious, e.g., hungry or not hungry, and others more complex, e.g., choosing between different food sources and determining whether to eat reduced-quality resources with possibly novel or aversive tastes in order to survive.
* Flight/Locomotor/Equilibrium

Locomotor behavior and flight behavior in flies both require a complex coordination. Both behaviors depend on the integration of various inputs, such as visual cues or proprioceptive information, to ensure accurate movement and equilibrium.
* Olfactory avoidance
* Learning/ Memory
* Geotaxis/Gravitaxis
* Phototaxis

 Phototaxis behavior implies the movement of an organism in the direction of a light source or away from it. **While adult flies are positively phototactic, larvae are photophobic**. These light preferences can be crucial for survival. 1) **Adult phototaxis behavior** is polygenic and is influenced by different factors such as age or rhabdomere structure of the eye. 2) **Light avoidance in larvae** is regulated by the paired Bolwig organs, which form the primitive eye structures in this life stage and which are connected to the pigment dispersing factor expressing lateral neurons. Further, it has also been shown that light sensitive dendrites in the body wall contribute to this behavior as well as two pairs of isomorphic neurons in the central brain which seem to be involved in the decision between light and dark.
