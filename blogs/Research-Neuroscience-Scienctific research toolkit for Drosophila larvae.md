## Category of research methods
### Gene expression
* **Gal4-UAS system** 

 The GAL4-UAS system is a technique enabling the expression of a gene of choice in a defined spatiotemporal pattern. 
GAL4 is a tran-scription factor from yeast that was adapted for use in Drosophila by Brand and Perrimon. 
In short, when the expression of GAL4 is under the control of a particular enhancer 
(e.g., an enhancer that is activated in all mushroom body neurons), 
the GAL4 line can be used to express any gene of interest in the same pattern by cloning the coding cDNA behind the UAS sequence. 
When both components are present in the same fly, the GAL4 protein that is expressed will bind to the UAS sequence, 
activating the expression of the gene of interest. More recently, it has become possible to more finely control activation of 
GAL4-mediated gene expression via use of the Gal80 protein, which binds GAL4 and inhibits it from binding the UAS sequence.[1]
